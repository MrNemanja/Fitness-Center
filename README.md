This project is a Fitness Center Management Web Application designed to manage fitness centers, group trainings, and user roles. 
It supports three types of users — Visitor, Trainer, and Owner — each with specific functionalities. 
Visitors can browse fitness centers, register for group trainings, and leave reviews. 
Trainers can manage their own training sessions, view participant lists, and track training history. 
Owners can manage fitness centers, add trainers, approve or reject comments, and oversee operations. 
The system provides role-based access, search and sorting features, profile management, and scheduling, offering a comprehensive platform for fitness center administration.
